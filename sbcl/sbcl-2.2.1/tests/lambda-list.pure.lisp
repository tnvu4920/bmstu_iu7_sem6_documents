;; CLHS 3.4.4 says
;; "&whole is followed by a single variable that is bound to the entire
;;  macro-call form; this is the value that the macro function receives
;;  as its first argument."
;;
;; but 3.4.4.1.2 says
;; "&whole - The next element is a destructuring pattern that matches
;; the entire form in a macro, or the entire subexpression at inner levels."
;;
;; So one paragraph says "a single variable" and the other "a pattern".
;;
;; If it can be a pattern, then it constrains the expected shape of input
;; in a way that can conflict with the remainder of the pattern.
;; e.g. Given (FOO (&WHOLE (BAZ BAR) X &OPTIONAL Y) MUM), would the
;; outer list's second element need to be a list that matches both
;; (BAZ BAR) and (X &OPTIONAL Y)?  Implementations disagree on this.
;;
;; Further 3.4.4 says "&whole can appear at any level of a macro
;; lambda list. At inner levels, the &whole variable is bound to the
;; corresponding part of the argument, as with &rest, but unlike &rest,
;; other arguments are also allowed."
;; This makes a strange implication that "&rest" does NOT allow
;; "other arguments", when clearly &REST can be followed by &KEY and
;; &AUX (if it means "formal" arguments), and followed by anything at
;; all if it means "actual" arguments. So it's not obvious from this
;; how &whole is supposed to be "unlike" &rest.
;;
;; And finally
;;   "The use of &whole does not affect the pattern of arguments specified."
;; which is is inconsistent in the case where you write
;; (&WHOLE (A B) ...) which certainly seems to require that the whole
;; form be exactly a 2-list. What it was trying to clarify - reasonably
;; in the case where &whole binds one symbol - is that
;;    (DEFMACRO MUMBLE (&WHOLE FOO) ...)
;; in terms of the pattern accepted, is exactly the same as
;;    (DEFMACRO MUMBLE () ...)
;; which means that MUMBLE accepts zero arguments.
;; This is a justified point because the equivalence of &WHOLE
;; and &REST at inner levels suggests that (&WHOLE FOO) actually means that
;; MUMBLE accepts anything when in fact it does not.
;;
;; To resolve these problems, we'll say that &WHOLE at the outermost level
;; of a macro can only bind one symbol, which fits the mental model that it
;; receives the input form and nothing but that.
;; Whoever uses &WHOLE with a non-symbol after it deserves a kick in the head.
